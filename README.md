- Creation of at least two sprites for the activity
- Use of one original sound that can play back on the app
- Use of accelerometer to move the player
- GIF of the game working placed inside of the readme file
- Pair Programming, both students should know what the code is doing.
- A winning condition -- Chance to play again.
- Two levels

## On this readme place the following
1. Description of the app. Who is it for/What does it do/How do you play? Anything broken, additional features?
2. A gif animation of the game working
3. Screenshot of design view
4. Screenshot of blocks that you worked really hard on.
5. Description 4 sentences on how the accelerometer works with your app. What are the values used? How does it move your object.
